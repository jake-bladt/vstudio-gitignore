# Default gitignore for Visual Studio projects.

This is a template for gitignore files for use in Visual Studio projects. It pattern-matches the following:

- Files created by Windows for tracking thumbnails
- Files created by OSX for directory metadata
- Visual Studio compiled and intermediary files and other build artifacts
- Artifacts created by MonoDevelop
- Artifacts created by JetBrains tools (Resharper and DotCover)
- Artifacts created by testing tools
- SASS intermediary compilation artifacts
- Project build files
- Binary package files created by Nuget and Chocolatey. (Remove if you use git to manage your external packages.)
- Temp files
- In-IDE database artifacts

Specific projects often require specific inclusions and exclusions. More general patterns will be pushed to this repo.
